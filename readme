 The program finds a suitable number of equal temperaments for a series of notes or ratios.
 It is useful for inharmonic tuning.

Separate individual items with a space bar. There are two ways to use this program: 1, enter the frequencies (Hz) from tonic to the octave;

An example of entering an inharmonic scale in frequency:

    220  259.2   302.5   329.6296296   362.3290203   432.8

2, enter the ratio of every note relates to the tonic form to the octave

An example of entering a major scale in ratios (just intonation):

    1 1.12246 1.25992 1.33483 1.49831 1.68179 1.88775 2

The boundary of matching frequency is +/-15 cents which is an average number of comparing 12-TET and just intonation.
It an be changed on lines 7 and 9.

The upper limit of finding the ET is 40, it can be changed on line 15
